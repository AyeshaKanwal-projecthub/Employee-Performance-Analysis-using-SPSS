# Employee-Performance-Analysis-using-SPSS
Job performance is a critical factor in organizational success, influenced by a range of individual and organizational factors. Among these, the work environment and employee recognition are commonly considered key determinants of performance outcomes. A supportive work environment can enhance employee well-being, motivation, and productivity, while recognition is believed to reinforce positive behaviors and boost engagement. However, the relative impact of these factors on job performance may vary across contexts and industries.

This study aims to examine the impact of work environment and recognition on job performance using SPSS statistical analysis. By analyzing data collected from 92 respondents, the research investigates how these factors individually and jointly influence employee performance. Through reliability, descriptive, correlation, and regression analyses, the study seeks to identify which factor contributes more significantly to job performance, providing insights that can guide organizational strategies to enhance productivity and employee satisfaction.
